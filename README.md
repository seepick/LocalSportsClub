  in `build/composebinaries/main/...` (built seperately on macOS, Linux, Windows).

# TODOs

## Next up

* sync venue details

* open USC website button

## Backlog

* workout metadata teacher (von partner site scrapen)
* alle QR codes von partner fotografieren, in app geben (prevent no-show-fee ;)
